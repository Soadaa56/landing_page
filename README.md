This page will be used as a templete in the future to create a webpage showing off various creations my gf has made. Almost like a virtual business card. I will need to teach myself a lot about how to make websites function correctly on various mobile devices. <br /><br /><br />


This project is to test and expand my skills for creating a landing page. <br />

The Odin Project will be supplying me with a layout to recreate, along with a template of what fonts and colors to use. This project will use all the skills that I've learned of html and css from The Odin Project. It will also test my ability to lookup (google) and learn new skills as they become needed to complete this project. <br />
